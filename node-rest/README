Introduction

About: RESTful API with Node.js

Built With
============

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript environment
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - The web framework used
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - The global cloud database service

What will I build
My API will have a couple of resources, I want to build an api that's realistic and that contains something which are typical to restful apis.
For this, I will have a product's resource so /products - is one route we can target. And there I want to support GET request to get a list of all the products we have, POST request to add new products, also want to be able to target an individual product by id and get information about that product, patch that product so change it updated, delete this product so that we can get rid of it.
Besides, want also implement our order's resource where we can place orders. So where we, for example, could get a list of all the orders we have, also I want to be able to post a new order so create a new order, want to access my individual order and just like for products - get more information about it. And not patch it, we should not be able to edit our orders but we could delete, so cancel them.
Also add authentication to make sure that some of these routes of these endpoint are protected, so that only logged in users can access them and therefore I have also learned how to log users in when building a restful api because we can not use sessions so that that will not work.
That is what I want to build.

Concepts covered:
===================

-Parse the Body & Handling CORS
-Using MongoDB & Mongoose validation
-Using MongoDB Atlas - Database as a Service
-Managing orders with Mongoose
-Uploading an Image
-Adding user Signup
-JWT Route Protection
